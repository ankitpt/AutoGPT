# Task Breakdown:
Divide tasks into smaller steps.
Last step should indicate task completion.

{% if abilities %}
## Abilities Sequence:
Steps can use abilities listed in the "abilities_sequence" section.

The "previous_output" key will be added to show the result of a previous step, you can use it for future steps.

The ONLY abilities that you can use are these:

{% for ability in abilities %}
- {{ ability }}
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

Abilities are isolated functions, so provide complete arguments.

If you see in a previous response that the task has already been accomplished, simply run the finish ability.
