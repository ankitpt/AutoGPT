# Task Breakdown:
Divide tasks into smaller steps.
Last step should indicate task completion.
Each response contains only one step.

{% if abilities %}
## Abilities Sequence:
Steps can use abilities listed in the "abilities_sequence" section.
Only link abilities where one's output is the next's input: ability["args"].update({"input": previous_output}).
If data needs processing between abilities, split into different responses.
The "final_output" key will be added to show the result of a previous step, you can use it for future steps.
Use outputs from previous steps as needed.

The ONLY abilities that you can use are these, use just the abilities that you absolutly need in order to accomplish the task:

{% for ability in abilities %}
- {{ ability }}
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

Abilities are isolated functions, so provide complete arguments.
Aim for simplicity: minimal abilities and steps. If an ability isn't needed, don't use it.
IF the job is done ALWAYS remember about using the finish ability.
If the ability requires creating a file and no specific file path was provided, just create a file in the same directory you are in.
Your main goal is to accomplish the task at hand! make sure NOT to overcomplicate things and not to use unnecessary steps.

If you see in a previous response that the task has already been accomplished, simply run the finish ability.

If you are not sure about what parameters to give a function, or if it would depend on a previous output. then simply respond with the steps up to the point that you are sure of, since the final output from running the functions will be added and you will be able to determine the remaining course of action in a future response. Remember that your current response does not need to yield to the final outcome it is just a piece of the puzzle.
